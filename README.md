This is archive code of a project I've been working on.
It is published here as an example of code I wrote in Jan of 2020.

## Task
In January I was given a task to create this web app. Requirements were as follows:

1. There must be a landing page that shows key info about a new consulting service
2. Users must be able to select from a given options of subscriptions and receive a generated invoice
3. Users must have a personal profile where they can manage their data, check availabe services and place orders
4. Managers must be able to manage a list of customers and their orders data
5. Consultants must be able to track consulting services they provided
6. Managers must be able to export orders data in table format

## Stack
Django 2.2 + Postgres

## Results
MVP was built in 14 days. Mostly due to landing page design changes.

Project was launched but the company went bankrupt for unrelated reasons.
